This is Ran's journey to see the world of 0/1.


# Motivation

Computers are stupid. They can only understand 0/1, but the world today would be a different world without them.

How these monsters who only know 1/0 can predict the Drag coefficient with amazing accuracy?

This is where the journey begains. I want to see them.
