  <2019-07-14 Sun>: go though the website and familiar with the
  structure of this journey and the book.

* Project 1

** goal

   Implement all the logic gates presented in the chapter. The only building
   blocks that you can use are primitive Nand gates and the composite gates that you
   will gradually build on top of them.

   | Gate      |   |

   NAND: it can build any type of gates only using NAND.

   <2019-07-21 Sun> Quick go thought Chapter 1 and working on Appendix
   A now.
