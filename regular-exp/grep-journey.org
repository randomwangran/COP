   Study regular expression is like studying how to create a car not
   _drive_ a car.

   This is something that also applied to the study of CFD.

** Can you do reg-exp to 24 format time?

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     grep "[012][0-9]:[0-5][0-9]" example.org
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS:
   | 10:57 |
   | 12:30 |
   | 23:48 |
   | 00:11 |
   | 09:59 |

   I don't know exactly what the book want me to write? I don't know
   the meaning of this question.

   My regular expression just search the time with a format that is 24
   format. The result shows a positive result.
