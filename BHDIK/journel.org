  when s is off, what will happen?

  I see the gates openning and closing but I cannot understand why the
  author say it is "memory"? When 's' is off, 'o' stays the way it
  was. How can this called memory? From my understanding, if there is
  nothing there, ( no wires or gates ), everytime a person observing
  the state of 'o', 'o' is still 'o'. Is this called memory? In my
  navive eye, memory is something one can pick...

  Wait, what is memory?

  I still don't understand hwo 4 ngates create a one bit memory.
