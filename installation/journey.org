* Motivation

Install software can be hard sometimes, this journey is to track what
I've done during these years playing with installation.


** essential software

*** install git on Centos 7

    I need git > 2.2 to make magit running, but the machine only have
    1.8.

*** journey

    We don't have openssl.


    $ ./configure prefix=~/opt NO_OPENSSL
    $ make all
    $ make install
    
    So easy. It is installed in:

    /home/superran/opt/bin
    
    git version 2.21.0.rc2.5.gc65a288

    And I change .bashrc:

    export PATH=/home/superran/opt/bin:$PATH

*** install paraview
** add-ons
