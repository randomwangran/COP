Install software can be hard sometimes, this journey is to track what
I've done during these years playing with installation.


** essential software

*** install git on Centos 7

    I need git > 2.2 to make magit running, but the machine only have
    1.8.
    #+BEGIN_SRC 
    LSB Version:	:core-4.1-amd64:core-4.1-noarch
    Distributor ID:	CentOS
    Description:	CentOS Linux release 7.3.1611 (Core) 
    Release:	7.3.1611
    Codename:	Core
    #+END_SRC

**** journey

     We don't have openssl.

     #+BEGIN_SRC 
     $ ./configure prefix=~/opt NO_OPENSSL
     $ make all
     $ make install
     #+END_SRC
    
     So easy. It is installed in:

     ~/home/superran/opt/bin~
    
     ~git version 2.21.0.rc2.5.gc65a288~

     And I change ~.bashrc~:

     ~export PATH=/home/superran/opt/bin:$PATH~

     And my magit workâ„¢.
