*** 100 faster 
    cool, IBM 704 and you guys wanna build a new computer 100 faster
    than it? If I were one of the people working on that project, I
    would probaly say impossible. What a brave heart.

    In practical, however, any general-purpose computer can do any
    programmable problem, given enough time.

*** I had a dream
    to build my computer to just run my emacs to do my daily jobs. Just
    like what I do right now.
